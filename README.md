### Concepts
I have spent a lot of time understanding the habits of good programmers, critical thinkers and problem solvers in hopes of refining those skills myself.
Data structures, algorithms, code time and space complexity, design patterns, efficient design, maintainability, readability. Different paradims such as OOP, functional programming (the one I'm most familiar with and my favorite at the moment) or procedural programming. 
I'm also spending a lot of time learning higher maths, partly because I find it interesting and partly because I think it is extremely powerful in this modern world.
